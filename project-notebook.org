#+TITLE: Project Notebook


* INFERENCE
** CVXPY inference algorithm [0/2]
*** TODO Auto-generate cliques of graph
*** TODO

* VIZ
** QUEUE
*** STRT Refactor drawing modes
Remove "Select" as a mode.
Make it, as well as the "t" key, special submodes, that only apply for
a single operation.

*** TODO Actions + Keystroke Display
Make such "Special Operations" visually clear and automatically display which ones are available. Important for ease of use

*** Visual [2/8]
**** DONE draw labels
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-05-23 Mon 16:02]
:END:
**** KILL change \delta (edge offset) + length parameters of hyperedges
:LOGBOOK:
- State "KILL"       from "TODO"       [2022-05-23 Mon 16:02]
:END:
**** TODO make self-edges prettier
One possibility: multiple link nodes.
**** TODO double-headed arrows
**** TODO circle-tailed arrows
*
**** TODO LaTeX in nodes & arrows;
**** TODO scaling diagrams
**** TODO snap-to


*** TODO Simulation Toggle-able.

*** Structure Editing
**** STRT Moving.
Blender style
**** TODO Scaling.
Issue: distances are for pairs of connected nodes / links.
So how do you scale things separately?

**** TODO Rename labels


*** Edge Focus
**** TODO CPD editor

*** Node Focus
**** TODO Value Editor
**** DONE Associate list to each node
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-12-12 Mon 18:56]
:END:
**** See: Multi-PDG below

*** TODO UNDO

*** Multi-PDG [0/3]
**** TODO Nested Borders (Compress full PDGs as nodes + folding)
**** TODO Split and Merge functionality
**** TODO Move entire PDGs around the screen


** WISHLIST
*** Other Inputs
**** Draw on Tablet
**** Parse from Image
*** Importing of other formats
**** .csv
**** graph formats (.dot, ...)
**** .pdg files
**** Class Graph / Objet Graph from javascript
*** Queries + Analytics
**** Inconsistency
**** Visualize a Joint distribution
**** Information Diagrams (both for joint dists + PDGs)

** FINISHED
*** [X] bounding box for nodes
*** [X] edge labels in hypergraph
*** [X] new "node" for each hypergraph
*** [X] repulsion between edges
*** [X] add "new node" tool
*** [X] add "new hyperedge" tool
*** [X] selection: (nodes + edges)
*** [X] selection operators: union, subtraction
*** [X] drawing selection
*** [X] painting selection
*** [X] add to hyperedges w/drawing
*** [X] select edges
*** [X] import / export
